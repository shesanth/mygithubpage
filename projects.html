        <h3>Python Roguelike</h3>
        <img src="roguelike.PNG" alt="example gameplay" style="width:100%;height:100%;"></img>
        <p>I created a basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">roguelike</a> game in Python. It features ASCII graphics and several randomly generated levels for the player to explore and fight enemies in. The code is highly modular and I plan to expand on it heavily. <a href="https://github.com/shesanth/roguelike"> Here</a> is a link to the GitHub page where you can download and play the game yourself! </p>
        <h3>The Diamond Mobile</h3>
        <img src="diamond.png" alt="how the car works" style="width:100%;height:100%;"></img>        
        <p>I was tasked in my Engineering 100: Microprocessors and Toys class to create an educational, microprocessor based toy prototype that could be completed and available in stores to fill a niche in the toy market. My team and I created The Diamond Mobile: a Programmable RC car used to teach children the basics of programming in a fun, concrete way. </p>

        <p>We used an Altera DE2-115 board connected to a keyboard, monitor, and XBee wireless controller for inputting commands. This was done completely in assembly. The car itself is controlled by an Arduino (programmed in C) connected to Orion RoboClaw motors which drive the wheels.</p>
